        <h2>Description of Butter Chicken</h2>
            <p>Butter Chicken is an ‘accidental’ dish. It was developed by Kundal Lal Gujral of the famous Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi who wanted to make use of leftover tandoori chicken. So he would throw in tomatoes, spices and leftover shredded tandoori chicken in a pot and slowly this came to be called ‘butter chicken’ or chicken makhani or murgh makhani. Now it’s one of the most popular and loved Indian dishes across the world. A restaurant favourite, but if you ask an Indian, it’s probably a ‘special occasion’ dish at home.</p>

        <h2>Steps to prepare Butter Chicken!</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Marinate the chicken: Combine yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, chili powder, garam masala and salt. Add chicken pieces, mix well, and marinate at least 30 minutes (or overnight for best flavor).</li>
                <li>Cook the chicken: Grill, pan-sear, or bake the marinated chicken until just cooked through and slightly charred on the edges. (If pan-cooking, use a splash of oil and cook on medium-high for 3–4 min per side depending on piece size.) Set aside.</li>
                <li>Start the sauce: In a heavy pan, heat oil + 2 tbsp butter. Add finely chopped onion and cook on medium heat until golden and caramelized (8–10 min). This builds flavor.</li>
                <li>Add aromatics: Stir in 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste, cook 1–2 minutes until raw smell disappears.</li>
                <li>Tomato base: Add tomato purée, turmeric, chili powder, salt and a small pinch of sugar. Simmer the sauce on low-medium for 10–12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens and the oil separates slightly.</li>
                <li>Blend (optional): For an extra-smooth sauce, cool slightly then blitz with an immersion blender or transfer to a blender and puree until silky. Return to the pan.</li>
                <li>Finish the sauce: Add remaining butter and simmer. Stir in cream and crushed kasuri methi. Taste and adjust salt/sugar. Add garam masala and simmer 2–3 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Combine chicken & sauce: Add the cooked chicken pieces to the sauce and simmer gently for 5–7 minutes so the flavors marry. If sauce is too thick, add a splash of water or cream to reach desired consistency.</li>
                <li>Garnish & serve: Turn off heat, sprinkle chopped coriander and a small pat of butter. Serve hot with naan, roti, or steamed basmati rice.</li>
            </ol>
