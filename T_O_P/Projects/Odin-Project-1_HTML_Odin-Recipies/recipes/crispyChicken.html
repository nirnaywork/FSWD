    <h2>Description Of Crispy Chicken</h2>
            <p>Chicken Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful South Asian rice dish made with aromatic basmati rice, tender chicken, and a blend of rich spices. The chicken is first marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked with caramelized onions, tomatoes, and herbs to create a deep, savory masala. Layers of partially cooked basmati rice are added on top, along with saffron milk, fried onions, and fresh herbs. The dish is then slow-cooked (dum style) to let the flavors blend beautifully. Each spoonful offers a perfect balance of juicy chicken, spiced rice, and aromatic goodness — a true celebration of flavor and tradition.</p>
