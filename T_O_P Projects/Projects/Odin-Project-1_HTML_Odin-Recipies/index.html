        <h1>Odin Chicken Recipes (Indian)</h1>
        <p>Picture a feast of Indian flavors: Chicken Biryani, Crispy Chicken, and Butter Chicken. The biryani greets you with saffron, spices, and warm, fragrant rice that dances on your tongue. The crispy chicken cracks with every bite, giving way to juicy, peppery meat. Then the butter chicken glides in, creamy, rich, and comforting, coating the tender chicken in silky, spiced sauce. Together, they create a symphony of spice, texture, and warmth. India’s essence served on a plate.</p>
